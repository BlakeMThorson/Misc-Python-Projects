#API CALLS & DISCORD BOTS

this is a collection of python files I've written that use APIs in some way


#Chris Chan Bot:
The chris chan bot was a web scraping Discord bot that scraped information from the "cwcki." It was able to summarize articles, scrape important information from the homepage, etc.

#Quotes Book Bot:
Using the Goodreads API for author quotes, you were able to name any author and it would return a random quote from them. It would return an error message if you entered an invalid author. 

#Weather Bot:
it does the weather by zipcode, everyone has built one, it scrapes the information and (used to) utilize an API before it was shut down.

#Cat Bot:
Uses the cat fact API

#Joke Bot:
Uses the joke API
